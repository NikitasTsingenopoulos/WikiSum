Make sure to include background information on your study site, why your interviewees are a good sample, and what makes your problem pressing to give your audience a panoramic view of the issue. After you've clearly stated the problem at hand, of course. Include photos or a video if it would benefit your work to be persuasive and personalized. As you go through each one, take adequate notes so you can find the info later on! Search for case studies that have been published on the same or similar subject matter. Talk to your professors, go to the library, surf the web until your bum falls asleep. You don't want to replicate the research that has already been done. Find out what has been written before, and read the important articles about your case's situation. . You also need to ask questions that will give you facts that might not be available from an article--make your work different and purposeful. Set up interviews with subject matter experts (account managers in a corporation, clients and customers using applicable tools and services, etc. ). Make sure all your informants are aware of what you're doing. If you have written a good case, they will have enough information to understand the situation and have a lively class discussion. Add references and appendices (if any). Just like you would in any other paper, reference your sources. That's why you got credible ones in the first place. And if you have any information that relates to the study but would have interrupted the flow of the body, include it now. You may have terms that would be hard for other cultures to understand. As your work is forming, you'll notice that it may morph into an object you didn't otherwise expect. If it does so, make additions and deletions as needed. Go over your study section by section, but also as a whole.
